# Work Parties

The Meany Lodge committee organize and participate in annual work parties that maintain and prepare the lodge for the Winter skiing season.

This repository is an idea that _might_ make the organization and sharing of our activities easier to track, delegate, and otherwise manage. If you're willing to give this idea a whirl:

- browse the [existing issues](https://github.com/MeanyLodge/Committee/issues). Post photos, revise, or share comments on them.
- [create an issue](https://github.com/MeanyLodge/Committee/issues/new) or two
- review or edit one of the [wiki pages](https://github.com/MeanyLodge/Committee/wiki)
- after kicking the tires, invite someone else to


## potential benefits

- issues and pages can be edited by multiple collaborators
- easier for new collaborators to a project to "catch up"
- linked and related issues can break down big projects into bite-sized (1 day/weekend) pieces
- emails updates to issues to everyone who participates in that issue
- automatic progress tracking
- we can post images inside the issues
- it's free
- data is free from "on so-and-so's phone/computer" issues

## potential issues

- only basic ([Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)) formatting available
- makes us look ðŸ¤“

# Work Parties

The Meany Lodge committee organize and participate in annual work parties that maintain and prepare the lodge for the Winter skiing season.

This repository is an idea that _might_ make the organization and sharing of our activities easier to track, delegate, and otherwise manage. If you're willing to give this idea a whirl:

- browse the [existing issues](https://github.com/MeanyLodge/Committee/issues). Post photos, revise, or share comments on them.
- [create an issue](https://github.com/MeanyLodge/Committee/issues/new) or two
- review or edit one of the [wiki pages](https://github.com/MeanyLodge/Committee/wiki)
- after kicking the tires, invite someone else to
- comment on Issue [#10](https://github.com/MeanyLodge/Committee/issues/10) (is this a good idea?)

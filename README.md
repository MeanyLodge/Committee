# Work Parties

The Meany Lodge committee organize and participate in annual work parties that maintain and prepare the lodge for the Winter skiing season.

This repository is an idea that _might_ make the organization and sharing of our activities easier to manage. If you're willing to give this idea a whirl:

- create an issue or two
- post some photos or share comments on existing issues
- after kicking the tires, invite someone else to


## potential benefits

- emails updates to issues to everyone who participates in that issue
- automatic issue tracking
- we can post images inside the issues
- it's free
